üßæ Subscription Management System
A Django-powered application to manage user subscriptions with real-time USD‚ÜíBDT currency exchange tracking. It includes user-friendly APIs, background rate logging via Celery, and a clean web interface to display subscriptions.

‚öôÔ∏è How It Works
üîó Core Components
Backend: Django + Django REST Framework

Asynchronous Tasks: Celery with Redis

External API: Currency exchange rates (via exchangerate-api or similar)

Database: MySQL 

Frontend: Basic Bootstrap template (non-SPA)

Admin Panel: Django admin site for managing plans and logs

üì¶ Features in Detail
1. Subscription Plans
Admin users can create subscription plans via the admin panel. Each plan has:

A name

A price (in USD)

A duration (in days)

Plans are stored in the Plan model.

2. User Subscriptions
Authenticated users can subscribe to a plan. Each subscription:

Links a user to a plan

Has a start date, end date, and status

Status updates when cancelled or expired

Subscriptions are stored in the Subscription model. Subscriptions are created atomically using transaction.atomic() to ensure data integrity.

3. Background Task with Celery
A periodic task runs every hour:

Fetches the current USD ‚Üí BDT rate

Stores the value in the database (ExchangeRateLog)

This is implemented in tasks.py using Celery and scheduled using Celery Beat. Redis is used as the message broker.

To run:

bash
Copy code
celery -A subscription worker -l info
celery -A subscription beat -l info
4. Admin Panel
Navigate to /admin/ as a superuser.

From there, you can:

Add/edit/delete subscription plans

View or manage all user subscriptions

Browse the history of exchange rate logs

5. Frontend Interface
Go to /subscriptions/ to see a public-facing HTML table listing:

Username

Plan

Start Date

End Date

Status

This page uses Bootstrap and Django templates. No login is required to view this list.

6. Docker (Optional)
If included in your repo:

The app supports containerization via Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml.
